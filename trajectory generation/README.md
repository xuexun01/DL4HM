### 1. Introduction

&emsp;&emsp;The goal of generative models of individual human mobility is to generate synthetic trajecoties with realistic mobility patterns. The generated synthetic trajectories must reproduce a set of spatial and temporal mobility patterns, such as the distribution of characteristic distances traveled and the predictability of human whereabouts.
